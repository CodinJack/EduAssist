    But if '{topic}' is a normal topic then generate 20 multiple-choice questions on the topic "{topic}" with three difficulty levels:
    - First 12 should be beginner-level
    - Next 8 should be intermediate-level
    - Last 5 should be advanced-level
    
    Each question should be in JSON format like this:
