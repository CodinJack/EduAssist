docker build -t eduassist_api:latest .
docker run -p 8000:8080 eduassist_api
```

## Key Highlights

### **Authentication**

EduAssist uses **Firebase Authentication** to securely manage user access. Users can create accounts, log in, and track their quiz history and progress. To make the platform accessible and convenient, **guest users** are also supported. This allows individuals to try out the platform and take quizzes without creating an account. However, guest users will have limited access to features, such as the inability to save progress or appear on the leaderboard. This ensures that registered users receive the full benefits of the platform, while guests can still enjoy a seamless trial experience.

### **Quiz Creation**

EduAssist leverages **LLMs (Large Language Models)** to generate quizzes from any prompt, making it highly flexible and customizable. Users can create quizzes on a wide range of topics, from academic subjects to general knowledge and niche interests.  
To ensure a **safe and appropriate experience**, EduAssist includes **guardrails** to filter out NSFW (Not Safe For Work) or inappropriate content. The system automatically detects and blocks prompts or quiz content that may contain offensive, harmful, or adult material, ensuring a family-friendly and educational environment.

### **Practice Mode**

EduAssist offers a **Practice Mode** for users who want to sharpen their skills without affecting their overall score. In this mode, users can generate and attempt quiz questions freely, providing a stress-free environment for learning and experimentation.  
Unlike regular quizzes, the **results from Practice Mode** are not recorded in the userâ€™s score history or reflected on the leaderboard. This feature encourages students to practice as much as they want, improving their skills without worrying about their ranking.

### **Leaderboard**

To inspire healthy competition and motivation, EduAssist features a **Leaderboard** where students can see how they rank compared to their peers.  
The leaderboard displays metrics such as:

-   **Average score**: The cumulative points earned by each user.
-   **Top performers**: Highlighting the highest-scoring individuals.

By showcasing individual achievements, the leaderboard encourages users to stay engaged, challenge themselves, and strive for improvement, fostering a competitive yet educational community.
